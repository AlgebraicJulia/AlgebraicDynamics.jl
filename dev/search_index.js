A composition syntax may be either undirected or directed. In this library, composition is implemented for the following syntaxes:\nundirected wiring diagrams (an undireced composition syntax)\nwiring diagrams (a directed composition syntax)\nopen circular port graphs, also called open CPGs (a directed composition syntax)\nDefine a composition pattern. Implement a specific undirected wiring diagram, wiring diagram, or open CPG that defines how the primitive systems will be composed. The number of boxes in the composition pattern is the number of primitive systems that will be composed.\nDefine the primitive systems to compose.  For an undirected composition pattern the primitive systems are implemented by resource sharers. A resource sharer has four components:\nports\nstates\na dynamics function, f\na port map,  m\nThe dynamics function can be either continuous time dot u(t) = f(u(t) p t) or discrete time u_n +1 = f(u_n p t). In both cases u contains the state and p contains the parameters. Also in both cases, the port map assigns a state to each port. We say the port exposes the state it is assigned. For continuous time use ContinuousResourceSharer{T} and for discrete time use DiscreteResourceSharer{T}. The type T represents the values that the states can take on.\nFor a directed composition pattern the primitive systems are implemented by machines. A machine has five components:\ninputs (also called exogenous variables)\nstates\noutputs\na dynamics function,  f\na readout function,  r\nThe dynamics function can be either continuous time dot u(t) = f(u(t) x(t) p t) or discrete time u_n+1 = f(u_n x_n p t). In both cases u contains the state, x contains the exogenous variables, and p contains the parameters. Also in both cases, the readout function r(u(t)) is a function of the state. For continuous time use ContinuousMachine{T} and for discrete time use DiscreteMachine{T}. The type T represents the values that the inputs, states, and outputs can take on.\nCompose. The oapply method takes a composition pattern and  primitive systems, and it returns the composite system. Each oapply method implements an operad algebra which specifies a regime for composing dynmaical systems. See [Schultz et al. 2019] and [Vagner et al. 2015] for definitions of the operad algebras mathsfCDS and mathsfDDS for directed composition. See [Baez and Pollard 2017] for definitions of the operad algebra mathsfDynam for undirected composition. See [Libkind 2020] for a general overview of these operad algebras.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"AlgebraicDynamics.jl","title":"AlgebraicDynamics.jl","text":"Once you have built the composite system, you can solve and plot its solution.
